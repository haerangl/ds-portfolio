## Face in Point
### Convoluted Neural Network

This is a team project for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) - [Applied Machine Learning](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/207) course at UC Berkeley.

Our team participated in the [Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection), albeit after the challenge deadline has passed. As of May '20, we estimate that our model would place around 35th among the participants. 

While we are not making all the code public, you can see our model in action in a [web app](http://doctortensorflow.pythonanywhere.com/) and see the [deck we presented to the class](Face%20in%20Point%20-%20Presentation.pdf).

The skills that I'm trying to demonstrate are:
* Understanding of CNN 
* Familiarity with CNN architectures, such as LeNet-5 and VGG-16
* Dealing with missing data 
* Machine learning model evaluations
* Data augmentation
