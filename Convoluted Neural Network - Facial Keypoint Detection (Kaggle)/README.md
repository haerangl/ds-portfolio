## Face in Point
### Convoluted Neural Network

This is a team project for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) - [Applied Machine Learning](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/207) course at UC Berkeley.

**[Check out our web app!] (http://doctortensorflow.pythonanywhere.com/)**

Our team participated in the [Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection), albeit after the challenge deadline had passed. As of May '20, we estimate that our model would place around 35th among the participants. 

While we are not making our code public, please see our model in action in **our [web app](http://doctortensorflow.pythonanywhere.com/)**. We've also outlined our approach, challenges, and experience in the **[deck we presented to the class](Face%20in%20Point%20-%20Presentation.pdf).**

The skills that I'm trying to demonstrate are:
* TensorFlow and Keras 
* Understanding of CNN 
* Familiarity with CNN architectures, such as LeNet-5 and VGG-16
* Machine learning model evaluations
* Data augmentation
