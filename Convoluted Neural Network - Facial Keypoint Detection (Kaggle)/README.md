* While our code repo is not public just yet, please see our model in action in our [**web app**](http://doctortensorflow.pythonanywhere.com/). 
* We've also outlined our approach, challenges, and experience in the **[deck we presented to the class](Face%20in%20Point%20-%20Presentation.pdf).**

**Skills Demonstrated**
* TensorFlow and Keras 
* Understanding of CNN fundamentals  
* Familiarity with CNN architectures, such as LeNet-5 and VGG-16
* Machine learning model evaluations
* Data augmentation 

**Overview**

Our team tackled the [Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection) using CNN. As of May '20, we estimate that our model would place around 35th among the participants. We experimented with various methods to fill the missing data, CNN architectures, and data augmentation techniques. We achieved the minimum loss with the model featuring VGG-16, KNN to fill NAs, data augmentation, and transfer learning. The resulting model generalized well even on tilted or turned faces.
