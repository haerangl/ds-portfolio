## Finding Flipper, a Text Game
### Object-Oriented Programming in Python

I built an interactive text game in Python for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) - [Introduction to Data Science Programming](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/200) course at UC Berkeley.

It is a simple text game played on a command line prompt. The objective of the game is to tell Albert, the main character, to move around the house until he finds Flipper the cat. Finding the cat makes Albert happy.

The skills that I'm trying to demonstrate are:
* Use of modules
* Use of classes and methods
* Creating a .py file that can be run from the command line
* Error checking 
* Well-commented code writing
* Numpy and random number generation
* Setter and decorator methods
