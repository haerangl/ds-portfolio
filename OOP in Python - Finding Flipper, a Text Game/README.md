**Overview**

I built a simple text game to play in the command line prompt. The objective of the game is to tell Albert, the main character, to move around the house until he finds Flipper the cat. Inside the code, there are three classes--Friend, Activity, and Locations--each of which takes on various forms throughout the game and interacts with each other.
