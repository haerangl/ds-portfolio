## Dangerous Genetic Mutations
### Data Cleansing and Analysis in Python

This is an assignment I did for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) - [Introduction to Data Science Programming](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/200) course at UC Berkeley.

**Skills Demonstrated**
* Data cleaning
* Data exploration and validation
* Analysis and reasoning 
* Applying functions on data frames
* Working with key-value pairs, even if they look a little bit unconventional 
* Dealing with missing data 

**Overview**

I parse a Variant Call Format (VCF) file to explore genetic mutations data and identify which of those should be considered dangerous. The emphasis of the exercise is on parsing messy data (e.g., file headers; key-value pairs inside of some columns), data cleansing, and exploring to understand the contents and trends.
