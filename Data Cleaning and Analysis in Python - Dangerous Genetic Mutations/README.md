## Dangerous Genetic Mutations
### Data Cleansing and Analysis in Python

This is an assignment I did for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) - [Introduction to Data Science Programming](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/200) course at UC Berkeley.

I received a modified version of a VCF file, which included a tab-delimited file with some values including key-value pair data, and was asked to parse it and find meaningful information. Specifically, the data contained genetic mutation information, which I used to identify those mutations that should be considered dangerous. Pleaes note that I do not have a background in biology and the goal of this exercise is to get comfortable with data analysis. I have outlined any assumptions I made in the Jupyter Notebook. 

Skills I am trying to demonstrate are:
* Data cleaning
* Data exploration and validation
* Analysis and reasoning 
* Applying functions on data frames
* Working with key-value pairs, even if they look a little bit unconventional 
* Dealing with missing data
