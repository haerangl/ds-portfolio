## North Carolina Crime 1987
### Econometrics and Linear Regressions in R

This is a group project I worked on for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) - [Statistics for Data Science](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/203) class at UC Berkeley. 

My two teammates and I received a modified version of the [`Crime` Ecdat R dataset](https://rdrr.io/cran/Ecdat/man/Crime.html). We analyzed it for actionable insights about the determinants of crime in North Carolina that could generate data-driven policy suggestions.

The skills I am trying to demonstrate are:

* Familiarity with R - the language and markdowns 
* Exploratory data analysis 
* Log transformation of variables
* Statistical modeling: Built three models and compared them side-by-side
* Understanding of the key assumptions of linear regressions and their implications   
* Interpretation of linear regression models, including statistical and practical significance
