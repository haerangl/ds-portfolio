### Data Science in Training

A data analyst with 7 years of experience, I may have never been called a data scientist at work, but I've dedicated 30 hours/week for the last 12 months in a rigorous part-time data science masters program at UC Berkeley. This portfolio is a collection of work to demonstrate what I've learned.
