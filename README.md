## Haerang Lee's Data Science Portfolio

### Data Scientist in Training

A data analyst with 7 years of experience, I may have never been called a data scientist at work, but I've dedicated 30 hours/week for the last 12 months in a rigorous part-time data science masters program at UC Berkeley. This portfolio is a collection of my work to demonstrate my technical skills.

   1. [Experiment and Causal Inference in R - **Speaking Science: Effect of Locality in Science Engagement**](https://github.com/haerangl/speaking-science)\*  
   In this experiment, my team and I examine whether the proximity to the location discussed in a science news article affects the readerâ€™s engagement with the article and its topic. We carefully designed and conducted an online survey to collect raw data, then analyzed it using linear regressions to determine the causal relationship. We conclude that while locality increases readers' reading comprehension of the article and we may have had enough statistical power to detect real differences, the results may not generalize well to the broader world. 
   1. [Econometrics and Linear Regressions in R - **Crime in North Carolina**](Econometrics%20in%20R%20-%20NC%20Crime)\*  
   In this paper, my team and I examine the correlation between North Carolina's crime rate per county and a number of independent variables, including the average sentence length, percentage of racial minorities, and wages. We build and compare three linear models for their validity and robustness. Our results indicate that stricter criminal justice does not have practical implications in reducing crime.
