## Value of Care
### Data Analysis in Python Pandas

This is a group project I did for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) - [Introduction to Data Science Programming](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/200) course at UC Berkeley.

My teammate and I obtained the Hospital Compare datasets from the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services website. We used Pandas and MatplotLib to do an extensive data exploration to find where the best care in the US could be found. 

The skills that I'm trying to demonstrate are:
* Pandas
* Data exploration 
* Asking interesting questions 
* Data cleaning and sanity checks
* Compelling storytelling
* Data visualization (basic)
