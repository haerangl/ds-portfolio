## Value of Care
### Data Analysis in Python Pandas

This is a group project I did for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) - [Introduction to Data Science Programming](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/200) course at UC Berkeley.

**Overview**

In this group project, My teammate and I obtained the Hospital Compare datasets from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) website. We used Pandas and Matplotlib to do explore data and to find which hospitals offered the best care in the US. We observed that the hospitals in the Rocky West and Midwest regions scored consistently higher than the national average. We also noted that the patients could not always determine the quality of the medical processes they received, but they could tell when the quality of their experience was high.
